# Java-Playlist-Assignment
A graded assignment as part of my Computer Science course in April 2020. 
The task was to create Java classes to simulate Tracks and Playlists. 
In this repository I've attached the classes and the driver class I used to test each class.

WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS PROJECT:
-I learned more about different data structures like Linked Lists and HashMaps.
